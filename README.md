# Cron_O_Clock
Cron_O_Clock is a GUI for scheduling User interface notifications. At present it is a combination of two modules:
- AlarmWindow
- UserSettings

## AlarmWindow 
This folder holds is a basic script that can be called from the CLI. 
The script takes three arguments to generate an notification window.

## UserSettings
This GUI is where the schedule will be editable and configurable

## Why 
There are probably multiple examples of the app available in several locations.
I'm not as familiar with Cron as I would like to be, I think this project could be a good exercise in familiarizing myself with cron scheduling. 

## FYI
Check out the README.md files in the two modules for more details on their states.
